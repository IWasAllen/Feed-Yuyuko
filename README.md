# Note
this is currently being reworked

# Feed Yuyuko
This is a game where you have to feed Yuyuko with actual files to prevent her starving. Drag and drop a file to the game to make her eat it. Make sure you don't starve her, or feed too much.

You can explore lots of unique file type that may make Yuyuko react to it's properties,
so don't feed the wrong file!
