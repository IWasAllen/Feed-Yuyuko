# Feed Yuyuko
This is a game where you have to feed Yuyuko with actual files to prevent her starving.<br>
Drag and drop a file to the game, to allow her accessing it and eat it.<br>
Make sure you don't starve her, or feed too much.<br><br>
You can explore lots of unique file type that may make Yuyuko react to it's properties.<br>
Just don't feed the wrong file!
<br><br>

# Disclaimer
This game deletes files when feeding it to Yuyuko, therefore it is **NOT YET** sure if it's stable or not<br>
This is just an alpha version, so expect several bugs. For more information, [click here](https://github.com/IWasAllen/Feed-Yuyuko/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).

This is not meant to be an actual game, just for video content. Therefore the game's codes is a huge made.
