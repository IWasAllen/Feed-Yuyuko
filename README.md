# Feed Yuyuko
This is a game where you have to feed Yuyuko with actual files to prevent her starving.<br>
Drag and drop a file to the game, to allow her accessing it and eat it.<br>
Make sure you don't starve her, or feed too much.<br><br>
You can explore lots of unique file type that may make Yuyuko react to it's properties.<br>
Just don't feed the wrong file!
<br><br>

# Disclaimer
This game deletes files when feeding it to Yuyuko, therefore it is **NOT YET** sure if it's stable or not<br>
This is just an alpha version, so expect several bugs. For more information, [click here](https://github.com/IWasAllen/Feed-Yuyuko/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).<br><br>
The developer is not resposible for anything that happens to your device, and you may download the game at my own risk and consent.

# Downloads
By downloading this game, I promise that I have read the [disclaimer](https://github.com/IWasAllen/Feed-Yuyuko/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md) and I know what I'm doing.<br>
Make sure to extract them, so it saves the memory file.<br><br>

# Credits & Notes
The game's source code is really messy, it might not be memory efficient; everything is still in alpha.<br>
*I literally spent 1 whole month developing this game just to have some content on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UHVEM1aULXZKUN1YyTBiA)*
<br><br>
This is not meant to be an actual game and it's just for video content, but tried my best to make it anyway cause why not? Therefore, it is expected to be boring, and the source code is incredibly messy.
